## Brief
This is a simple drawing app that allows users to draw lines, circles, and other shapes. It also supports filling shapes with colors and patterns.

## Features
- Combine the console and window
- Choose the shape color before drawing from the menu
- Clear the screen from shapes
- Save all data in the screen
- Load data from files
- Implement line algorithms: DDA, Midpoint, and Parametric
- Implement circle algorithms: Direct, Polar, Iterative Polar, Midpoint, and Modified Midpoint
- Fill a circle with lines after taking the filling quarter from the user
- Fill a circle with other circles after taking the filling quarter from the user
- Fill a square with a Hermit curve (vertical)
- Fill a rectangle with a Bezier curve (horizontal)
- Convex and non-convex filling algorithms
- Recursive and non-recursive flood fill
- Cardinal spline curve
- Ellipse algorithms: Direct, polar, and midpoint
- Clipping algorithms using a rectangle as the clipping window: Point, line, and polygon
- Clipping algorithms using a square as the clipping window: Point and line

## Usage
To use the drawing app, simply clone the GitHub repo and run the main.cpp file. The app will open a window that you can use to draw shapes.
